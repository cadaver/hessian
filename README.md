Multidirectionally scrolling sideview action / adventure game for the Commodore 64. Strongly similar to the Metal Warrior series. Check the code only at your own risk, as
it will contain gameplay and story spoilers!

Technical details:

- 50Hz screen update with NTSC compatibility
- 8-directional scrolling with color per each char
- 24 sprite multiplexer
- Realtime sprite depacking for all sprites, using a sprite cache
- Dynamic memory allocation for sprites & level data
- NinjaTracker V2.03 music & sound playback
- Loader based on the CovertBitops Loader V2.24 (1541/1581/FD/HD/IDE64)
- Exomizer2 compression

"Kim, a night security guard working at Throne Group Science Complex wakes up in an improvised emergency operating room.
She remembers multiple hostiles opening fire on the staff, everything fading to black as rounds hammer into her chest..
and finally voices: 'Massive trauma.. need artificial circulation.. prepare the nanobot injection now!'"
